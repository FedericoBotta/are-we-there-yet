# University of Exeter interactive transport resources

Academics and students from the Computer Science department at the University of Exeter have been developing these interactive tools to explore different aspects of our city and how we can move around it.

In the lead up to this exhibition they shared their ideas with residents and community groups from different areas of Exeter and invited them to contribute to the development of these live research projects.  

This dashboard allows the user to explore how different areas in Exeter can access important services such as GP practices or parks, and shows a combined liveability index of different areas of Exeter based on a variety of data source.  Why donâ€™t you try out and compare different areas?

This simulation tool allows users to analyse different setups for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). You can see how different LTN designs affect things like pollution levels, travel distances and other measures of quality of life in the area. 
Try creating your own Low Traffic Neighbourhood design and compare it to others to see which is better.

Developed by: Scott Deverinne, Ahmad Hussain, Zdenek Plesek, Tomas Muniagurria, Ted Proctor, Oscar Rilot, and Diogo Pacheco.
